Remember the old message boards that had an RPG section? Y' know, where the
slightly weird members would hang out and post pretending they were elves
and vampires?

As a kid I was one of those, and I took the simple idea of an RPG section 
and made an entire forum. Each thread was a town or location, each account
a character in the story.

However, a forum was a limited platform. Very soon I needed learn how to
adapt the open-source forum to support character experience, a shop to buy
items and the profiles section needed expanding.

This was my introduction to programming, and in many ways the launch pad to
my career. The game itself was hugely popular, with many of the members
from 7 years ago still friends and still playing together elsewhere.

I've resurrected the project as my portfolio piece. Feel free to browse
it to look at my coding style, as well as see how I approach projects.

Eventually, I plan for this code to become and RPG Engine, allowing other,
more imaginative people to create and play in their own worlds. However,
my original game will also be resurrected, as the showpiece for the RPG engine.
